# 🔎 Binary Search

## 📌 Project Goal

The goal of this project is to implement a robust and efficient binary search algorithm. This implementation will serve as a practical example of algorithmic problem-solving and can be utilized as a utility function or integrated into a Nuxt 3 application as a composable hook. By completing this project, you will gain a deeper understanding of binary search and its applications, while also creating a portfolio-worthy demonstration of your skills in TypeScript and modern web development.

Implement the binary search algorithm as a utility or a composable hook using TypeScript and Nuxt 3 (if a UI is implemented). The result should be a simple yet powerful demonstration of one of the fundamental and widely used algorithms in Computer Science, which can be added to your portfolio or GitLab. Follow the conventional commit standard for version control.
